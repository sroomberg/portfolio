## Personal Online Equity Portfolio

This is an unfinished stock portfolio tracker. I've developed this to easily, and automatically calculate recognized gain in my portfolio while also live streaming stock quotes by scraping the Yahoo Finance API. The base functionality will be written almost entirely in PHP (most likely). There are plans to write in visual (graphing) capabilities into the tracker as well.
