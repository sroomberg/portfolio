## Equity Portfolio Tracker

This is an <em>unfinished</em> stock portfolio tracker. Developed entirely in PHP, you can easily, and automatically calculate gain in your portfolio.

Currently, there is no way to save data when you exit the program. This feature will be implemented at a later time.

To use, you must run this project on a server (localhost or remote).

## Future Plans

I would like to have this live stream quotes from the Yahoo Finance API so the user does not have to update the current price manually.

I plan to implement a database so users can save information after logging off.
